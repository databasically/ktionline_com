    <h2>History</h2><div id="node-11" class="node clear-block">



  <div class="content clear-block">
        <div class="intro">Early Years</div>
<p>KTI was founded in June of 1986 at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. During the first year, KTI provided testing services to general contractors as required by the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. </p>
<p>Over the next year, KTI's business boomed. In that time, KTI expanded its clientele list from one general contractor to approximately 20 general contractors. The majority of the work was related to government contracts at Whiteman Air Force Base, which was expanding to accommodate personnel and technical support facilities for the B-2 Stealth Bomber. </p>
<div class="intro">Consistent Growth</div>
<p>Recognizing that work could no longer be done efficiently in the small field trailer, plans were made in the fall of 1988 to move into a larger warehouse located in Knob Noster, Missouri. The additional space provided greater opportunity for expansion, and KTI was able to incorporate new features for its clientele. This office currently houses KTI's base of operations serving West Central Missouri, including Columbia, Lake of the Ozarks, Sedalia and Jefferson City.</p>
<div class="intro">Expansion to Kansas City Area</div>
<p>In 1990, KTI opened another office in Kansas City specializing in Special Inspection and Construction Materials Testing. At that time our Vice President, Otto J. Kruger, Jr., implemented Geotechnical Investigation capability by utilizing the best computer software available, further enhancing the services we offer to our clients. We have since experienced steady growth working for clients such as Black and Veatch, HNTB, The City of Kansas City, Missouri, KCMO School District, Hensel-Phelps, J.E. Dunn Construction, MA Mortenson, Tyson Foods, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, University of Missouri System, Hilton, Sprint and Station Casinos. </p>
<p>In 1998 and 1999, KTI was recognized in Ingram's Magazine's "KC's Top 100 Fastest Growing Businesses". To reflect the expanding range of services we offer to our clients, we changed our name in 1998 from KTI Construction Services to Kruger Technologies, Inc., dba KTI.  In 2000, KTI moved to its current corporate headquarters in Lenexa, Kansas.</p>
<div class="intro">Expansion and Growth</div>
<p>After setting growth records in 2009, KTI set its on even higher goals in 2010, opening new locations at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas and Ft. Leonard Wood, Missouri.  </p>
<div class="intro">Looking Forward</div>
<p>Over the past quarter century, we have devoted our time individually to each client, providing professional and quality service no matter the size of the project. We continue to receive strong market support and favorable recognition from our proven record of accomplishment. Our enthusiasm and positive attitude ensures exceptional performance.  This stability and performance is exemplified in KTI's continued growth and expansion during the great recession.</p>
